= Lab 2 - Change Data Capture

In this lab you will enable Change Data Capture (CDC) for a legacy application that loads the customer orders from a comman separated value (CSV) file. This old PHP application can't be modified so there is no way to modernize it without risks. You will enable CDC on the SQL server database where the orders are stored and create a Kafka Connect deployment using AMQ streams to emit data change events to the Earth Apache Kafka cluster.

Audience: Enterprise Integrators, System Architects, Developers, Data Integrators

*Overview*

Apache Kafka is the de facto standard for asynchronous event propagation between microservices. Things get challenging, though, when adding a service’s database to the picture: how can you avoid inconsistencies between Kafka and the database?

Enter change data capture (CDC) and Debezium. By capturing changes from the log files of the database, Debezium gives you both reliable and consistent inter-service messaging via Kafka and instant read-your-own-write semantics for services themselves.

*Why Red Hat?*

To respond to business demands quickly and efficiently, you need a way to integrate applications and data spread across your enterprise. Red Hat® AMQ—based on open source communities like Apache ActiveMQ and Apache Kafka—is a flexible messaging platform that delivers information reliably, enabling real-time integration and connecting the Internet of Things (IoT).

AMQ streams component makes Apache Kafka “OpenShift native” through the use of powerful operators that simplify the deployment, configuration, management, and use of Apache Kafka on OpenShift.

== Configure CDC connectors for Kafka Connect

There is already a legacy kafka deployment running. We will then deplopy a KafkaConnect CDC connector to connect to that cluster while we extract the data from the SQL Server Database.

=== Deploy KafkaConnect CDC Connector

. Get back, or Open a new tab with the OpenShift Developer Console link:{openshift-host}/topology/ns/{user-username}[Topology View, window="_blank"]. 
+ 
[IMPORTANT]
====
Be sure to be in your _{user-username}_ project

. Click *+Add* on the left menu.
+
image::images/topology-add.png[Topology Add, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. Click on the *From Catalog* option.
+
image::images/add-from-catalog.png[OpenShift From Catalog, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. Type in `kakfa` in the search text field and then click on *KafkaConnect*.
+
image::images/openshift-kafkaconnect.png[OpenShift KafkaConnect, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. Click on *Create* button.
+
image::images/openshift-create-kafkaconnect.png[OpenShift KafkaConnect, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. Create a `KafkaConnect` Kubernetes Custom Resource to define your connector. Replace the _YAML_ editor with the following code:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
kind: KafkaConnect
metadata:
  name: debezium
spec:
  bootstrapServers: 'earth-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.shared-kafka-earth.svc:9092'
  image: 'quay.io/hguerreroo/debezium-connect:0.10.0-sqlsrv'
  replicas: 1
  jvmOptions:
    gcLoggingEnabled: false
  config:
    group.id: {user-username}-connect-cluster
    offset.storage.topic: {user-username}-connect-cluster-offsets
    config.storage.topic: {user-username}-connect-cluster-configs
    status.storage.topic: {user-username}-connect-cluster-status
----

. Get back to the CodeReady IDE and expose the Kafka Connect REST API by running this command on the *Terminal* window.
+
--
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
oc expose service debezium-connect-api --name kafka-connect -n {user-username}
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Remeber to be logged into OpenShift and be in the correct _working_ project.
====

. Get back to the OpenShift developer console and open the topology view by clicking *Topology* in the left side menu
+
image:images/openshift-kafkaconnect-resource.png[Back To Topology]

. Wait for the default deployment to finish and deploy the required pod. Remember to wait for the dark blue circles.
+
image:images/topology-kafkaconnect.png[KakfaConnect Topology]

. Check that everything deployed correctly by clicking the *Open URL* icon.

. You should be able to see the information of the Kafka cluster version like the following:
+
[source,json,subs="attributes+"]
----
{"version":"2.2.1.redhat-00002","commit":"c330425647372ca2","kafka_cluster_id":"g0lUt2NARWSPxFn1Aq3uTw"}
----

. Now that we know that the Kafka Connect cluster is running let's create a new connector config to react to changes in the `Orders` table. Issue the following command in the CodeReady Terminal window:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
cat << EOF | curl -X POST -H "Accept:application/json" -H "Content-Type:application/json" http://kafka-connect-{user-username}.{openshift-app-host}/connectors -d @-
{
  "name": "orders-connector",
  "config": {
    "connector.class": "io.debezium.connector.sqlserver.SqlServerConnector",
    "database.hostname": "mssql-server-linux.shared-db-earth.svc",
    "database.port": "1433",
    "database.user": "sa",
    "database.password": "Password!",
    "database.dbname": "InternationalDB",
    "database.server.name": "{user-username}.earth",
    "table.whitelist": "dbo.Orders",
    "database.history.kafka.bootstrap.servers": "earth-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.shared-kafka-earth.svc:9092",
    "database.history.kafka.topic": "{user-username}.earth.dbhistory"
  }
}
EOF
----


If the last command was successful you should get the following output as return:

[source,json,subs="attributes+"]
----
{"name":"orders-connector","config":{"connector.class":"io.debezium.connector.sqlserver.SqlServerConnector","database.hostname":"mssql-server-linux.shared-db-earth.svc","database.port":"1433","database.user":"sa","database.password":"Password!","database.dbname":"InternationalDB","database.server.name":"{user-username}.earth","table.whitelist":"dbo.Orders","database.history.kafka.bootstrap.servers":"earth-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.shared-kafka-earth.svc:9092","database.history.kafka.topic":"{user-username}.earth.dbhistory","name":"orders-connector"},"tasks":[],"type":"source"}

== Deploying Apache Kafka on OpenShift

AMQ streams component uses powerful operators that simplify the deployment, configuration, management, and use of Apache Kafka on Red Hat OpenShift® Container Platform.

In this section you will learn how to start a local Kafka cluster that will represent the startup _Moon_ deployment.

. Deploy the startup _Moon_ AMQ streams Kafka cluster.

[id="replicating-to-other-kafka-clusters"]
== Replicating to other Kafka clusters

We refer to the process of replicating data between Kafka clusters "mirroring" to avoid confusion with the replication that happens amongst the nodes in a single cluster. Kafka comes with a tool for mirroring data between Kafka clusters.

The Cluster Operator deploys one or more Kafka Mirror Maker replicas to replicate data between Kafka clusters. The Mirror Maker consumes messages from the source cluster and republishes those messages to the target cluster. A common use case for this kind of mirroring is to provide a replica in another datacenter.

. Deploy the mirror maker cluster to _mirror_ the data from _Earth_ to _Moon_. (We do mean from the Earth Kafka cluster to the Moon Kakfa cluster)
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
cat << EOF | oc apply -n {user-username} -f -

== Testing that mirror maker works


== Loading Earth Orders



It's now time to test the full integration between the Earth and Moon Orders system.
. We will first load the csv data into MSSQL using a PHP app
. ebezium will populate data from MSSQL into the Earth Kafka topic
. Mirror Maker will then mirror the data in the Earth cluster to the Moon cluster.

. Launch a new tab on your web browser.
. Download to your local system the link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatWorkshops/dayinthelife-streaming/master/support/module-1/earth-orders.csv[Earth Orders File, window="_blank"].
. Navigate to the link:http://www-shared-app-earth.{openshift-app-host}/#{user-username}[PHP app, window="_blank"] in a new browser tab.
It can be found from your Openshift console-> project: www->routes.
Note: Make sure to add /#user1 to the route.

. Load the file in the PHP app.
The Php app looks like this on launch.

image::images/dil-lab2-phpapp.png[]
If this is successfully completed, you will see the csv data  on the PHP page.

image::images/dil-lab2-importeddataintophp.png[]

The data will thus be imported into MSSQL.

Test: This step is optional but helpful to avoid troubleshooting. Here is how to check that the data is loaded from the file into MS SQLserver.
. Open the Terminal on the Openshift console into the MSSQL Server pod and run the following commands.
You can oc rsh into the sqlserver pod as well.

.  cd /opt/mssql-tools/bin
. ./sqlcmd -S mssql-server-linux.shared-db-earth.svc -U sa -P Password! -d InternationalDB

[id="enabling-http-access"]
== Enabling HTTP access to Kafka

Apache Kafka uses a custom protocol on top of TCP/IP for communication between applications and the cluster. There are many client implementations for different programming languages, from Java to Golang, from Python to C# and many more.

However, there are scenarios where it is not possible to use the clients, or indeed the native protocol. Communicating with an Apache Kafka cluster using a standard protocol like HTTP/1.1 eases development these scenarios.

. Create the http `KafkaBridge` Custom Resource.
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
cat << EOF | oc apply -n {user-username} -f -
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1alpha1
kind: KafkaBridge
metadata:
  name: http
spec:
  bootstrapServers: 'moon-kafka-bootstrap.{user-username}.svc:9092'
  http:
    port: 8080
  replicas: 1
EOF
----

. Expose the bridge HTTP REST API service as a route for external access.
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
oc expose service http-bridge-service --name kafka-bridge -n {user-username}
----

. Wait for the bridge to be deployed.

. Create consumer to test the connection to your topic.
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
cat << EOF | curl -X POST http://kafka-bridge-{user-username}.{openshift-app-host}/consumers/{user-username}-http-group -H 'content-type: application/vnd.kafka.v2+json' -d @-
{
    "name": "{user-username}",
    "format": "json",
    "auto.offset.reset": "earliest",
    "enable.auto.commit": "false",
    "fetch.min.bytes": "1024",
    "consumer.request.timeout.ms": "30000"
}
EOF
----

. Notice the `base_uri`, it represents the REST resource for your customer.

. Use the previuos `base_uri` to request subscription to the topics.
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
curl -X POST http://kafka-bridge-{user-username}.{openshift-app-host}/consumers/{user-username}-http-group/instances/{user-username}/subscription -H 'content-type: application/vnd.kafka.v2+json' -d '{"topics": ["{user-username}.earth.dbo.Orders"]}'
----

. Now you can start to consume some records. Notice that you need to send `json` as the accept type.
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
curl http://kafka-bridge-{user-username}.{openshift-app-host}/consumers/{user-username}-http-group/instances/{user-username}/records -H 'accept: application/vnd.kafka.json.v2+json'
----

. Do it again until there is no more records to read.

== Summary

In this lab you used Debezium CDC connectors to react to change events from SQL Server and send them to Apache Kafka running on OpenShift through Red Hat AMQ streams.

Open source connectors enable integrations with your local systems landscape. Explore Kafka, Camel, and Debezium connectors to connect APIs and services for event-driven application architectures (EDA). Red Hat offers supported versions of these connectors via AMQ Streams and Fuse.

You can now proceed to link:{next-lab-url}[Lab 3].
