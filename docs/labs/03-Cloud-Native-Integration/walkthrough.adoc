= Lab 3 - Cloud-Native Integration with EIPs

In this lab you will stream events from an AMQ Online topic, use Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIPs) in Camel-K to split and route messages to a Datalake, in addition to streaming the messages to a Standard and Premium Shipping topic on Kafka.

Audience: Enterprise Integrators, System Architects, Developers, Data Integrators

*Overview*

Apache Kafka is the de facto standard for asynchronous event propagation between microservices. Things get challenging, though, when adding a service’s database to the picture: how can you avoid inconsistencies between Kafka and the database?

Enter change data capture (CDC) and Debezium. By capturing changes from the log files of the database, Debezium gives you both reliable and consistent inter-service messaging via Kafka and instant read-your-own-write semantics for services themselves.

*Why Red Hat?*

To respond to business demands quickly and efficiently, you need a way to integrate applications and data spread across your enterprise. Red Hat® AMQ—based on open source communities like Apache ActiveMQ and Apache Kafka—is a flexible messaging platform that delivers information reliably, enabling real-time integration and connecting the Internet of Things (IoT).

AMQ streams component makes Apache Kafka “OpenShift native” through the use of powerful operators that simplify the deployment, configuration, management, and use of Apache Kafka on OpenShift.

*Prerequisites*

This lab assumes you have successfully completed Lab 1.

== Provision AMQ Topic

In this task, you'll provision a messaging topic using Red Hat's Messaging as a Service platform on OpenShift (AMQ Online).

. Navigate to the {openshift-host}[OpenShift Admin Console, window="_blank", id="{context}-3"]

. Login to OpenShift Admin Console using your credentials (`{user-username}` and `{user-password}`).

. Select the *Administrator* drop-down, then select *Workloads*, *Config Maps* and click on the `amq-config` link.
+

. Scroll down towards the bottom of the page.  Copy/paste the `external.host`, `service.host` and `service.port.amqp` values to a text editor.  These are the messaging credentials created in Lab 1.  You will need these shortly.
+
image::images/1.1.4-configmap.png[1.1.4-configmap, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. In your text editor, copy the `external.host` value and replace the word `messaging` with `https://console`.  This will becoming your *AMQ Online Console URL*.
+

. Choose `Small Topic` then click *Next* and finally *Create*.
+
image::images/1.1.9-topic-details.png[1.1.9-topic-details, role="integr8ly-img-responsive"]

. Please wait a few minutes for the topic to provision.  Once the queue is provisioned, the topic name (`mytopic`) should have a green checkmark next to it.

== Summary

In this lab you used Debezium CDC connectors to react to change events from SQL Server and send them to Apache Kafka running on OpenShift through Red Hat AMQ streams.

Open source connectors enable integrations with your local systems landscape. Explore Kafka, Camel, and Debezium connectors to connect APIs and services for event-driven application architectures (EDA). Red Hat offers supported versions of these connectors via AMQ Streams and Fuse.

You can now proceed to link:{next-lab-url}[Lab 3].
