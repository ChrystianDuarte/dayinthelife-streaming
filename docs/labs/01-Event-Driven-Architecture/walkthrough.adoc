= Lab 1 - Event Driven Architecture

Since the acquisition, the International Inc.’s Development team has been pressured to make the transition smooth quickly. They have decided to start with a small notification project where it notifies both internal departments and external partners when an order has been placed. In this lab you will learn how to use Camel K to establish a simple Event Driven call. The old application uses traditional API calls to trigger system modification, your job is to use Camel K to re-write the notification application rather then using pure REST implementation convert it to event driven architecture.

Audience: Enterprise Integrators, System Architects, Developers, Data Integrators

*Overview*

Camel K is a lightweight cloud integration platform based on the Apache Camel framework. It runs natively on Kubernetes and Openshift and it’s specifically designed for serverless and microservice architectures.

AMQ online enable developers to provision messaging when and where they need it through a browser console. The AMQ online component is built on the foundation of Red Hat OpenShift, a container platform for high scalability and availability of cloud-native applications.

*Why Red Hat?*

To respond to business demands quickly and efficiently, you need a way to integrate applications and data spread across your enterprise. Red Hat® AMQ—based on open source communities like Apache ActiveMQ and Apache Kafka—is a flexible messaging platform that delivers information reliably, enabling real-time integration and connecting the Internet of Things (IoT).

AMQ streams component makes Apache Kafka “OpenShift native” through the use of powerful operators that simplify the deployment, configuration, management, and use of Apache Kafka on OpenShift.

. Wait for the workspace to start
. Click on the manage command on the top, run the following in orders
	1. Download Kamel Binary
	2. Unzip Kamel
	3. Setup apicall
	4. Setup eventdriven
. Close all commends, and go back to project explorer. 


=== Intall your Camel K Operator

. Go to OpenShift Console
. To your user project, user%d
. Go to the Installed Operators and click on Camel K Operator
. Click on the Integration Platform
. Create Integration Platform by clicking on the button, and save
. 

[time=10]
=== Create your topic 

==== Setup AMQ Online namespace
. Go to 
 https://console-workshop-operators.{openshift-app-host}/
 and login with your ID and PWD

. Create your AMQ namespace instance 
 - Namespace: {user-username}
 - Name: {user-username}
 - Type: Standard
 - Address Space Plan: standard-small
 - Authentication Service: standard-authentication


==== Create an Topic
. Click on the namespace you just created in the conole, it will take you to your online console.
