# Module Zero UI
This UI connects to a WebSocket server and displays the most recently received
events.

## Setup

* Node.js 10+
* npm 5+


### Local Development

```
npm install
npm run start-dev
```

The development setup includes a WebSocket Server that sends mock data to the
frontend. The data format is as a JSON Object with the following structure:

```
{
    datetime: Int,
    department: String,
    itemId: Int,
    qty: Int,
    price: String
}
```

### Deployment as Container

Build using the following command from this directory. Replace `$TAG_NAME` with
your chosen tag name.

```
docker build . -t $TAG_NAME
```

You can run the image via Docker like so. The `WS_CONNECTION_STRING` must be
set (an example is provided):

```
SOCKET_SERVER=wss://localhost:9090
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -e WS_CONNECTION_STRING=$SOCKET_SERVER $TAG_NAME:latest
```

Or you can push it to a registry and deploy on a container platform, e.g OpenShift.
